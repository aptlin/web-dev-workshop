# How to architect a web app and manage state

## Prerequisites

Explore the moodboard written using React, Typescript, [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io) and Auth0 SDK by running a dev server from the [demo folder](../demos/2/react-app-with-auth/README.md):

```bash
git clone https://github/sdll/web-dev-workshop.git
cd web-dev-workshop
cd demos/2/react-app-with-auth/
npm install
npm start
```

#### useDebugValue

> "Sometimes you might want to debug certain values or properties, but doing so might require expensive operations which might impact performance.
>
> `useDebugValue` is only called when the React DevTools are open and the related hook is inspected, preventing any impact on performance."
